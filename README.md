Public notebooks

To __properly__ view the notebooks, they should be viewed via [NBViewer][nbvp]. (Click link to browse this repo in NBViewer). 

They can also be viewed on GitHub directly, but on mobile devices it's needed to turn on "Desktop mode".

( Read more about NBViewer on [nbviewer.jupyter.org][nbv]. )
