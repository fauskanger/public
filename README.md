Public notebooks

To __run them__ on your own with Colaboratory: 
visit https://colab.research.google.com/github/fauskanger/public and pick notebook from repo browser. 
Some notebooks depend on account-based services (e.g. Twitter) and will not run out-of-the-box.

To properly view the notebooks on mobile devices, they can be viewed via [NBViewer][nbvp]. 
(Click link to browse this repo in NBViewer). 

They can also be viewed on GitHub directly, but on mobile devices it's needed to turn on "Desktop mode".
( Read more about NBViewer on [nbviewer.jupyter.org][nbv]. )
